# Network Request Challenege

This was a coding challenege to practice utilizing <code>fetch</code> in network requests to a provided API database.

The spec for this challenge can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-2/network-request-exercises.html).
<br>
The project asked for a visual display of GET, POST, and DELETE network requests, so I created a rudimentary webpage that allows a user to get the data, post a new piece of data, and delete a piece of data using an id. This was solely an excersize to better understand fetch and network requests.
